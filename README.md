# Solving-Mazes---DFS-BFS
This project uses DFS and BFS algorithms to solve mazes efficiently. DFS explores deeply along each branch, while BFS systematically explores all paths level by level. By comparing the performance of both algorithms, valuable insights are gained applicable in robotics, gaming, and network routing.
